        <li><strong>City Names:</strong> When you manually enter or save favorite locations.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Basic analytics for crash reporting and performance monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate weather forecasts</li>
        <li>Save your favorite locations locally on your device</li>
        <li>Improve app performance and fix errors</li>
    </ul>
